Based on your project's goals and the hackathon's judging criteria, your current "Trace Explorer" is a good log but not yet an observability tool. It shows what happened (Blocked/Safe) but not the full story of how or why the agent made its decisions.

To impress the judges, especially for Track B (Agent Glass Box), you need to visualize the agent's entire internal process.

Here’s a breakdown of the problem and a proposed visualization tool that will directly target the judging criteria.

🎯 The Problem: A Log, Not a "Glass Box"
Your current UI shows the final result of an interaction. The "BLOCKED" screenshot shows Detection Method: embedding_similarity and a 38.67% score, but it's a black box.

The judging criteria for Track B demand that you:


"Follow the trajectory" 


"Capture every decision, memory update, and tool interaction" 


"Reveal reasoning chains and decision paths" 

Provide "human-interpretable explanations" and "true auditability" 

Your UI isn't showing the LangGraph state machine in action. It's not explaining what the 38.67% was similar to, nor does it show the initial "Adversarial Pattern Detection" check that your README mentions.

💡 The Solution: The "Agent Decision Flow" Visualizer
I suggest replacing the static expanded view (Screenshot 1) with a dynamic, multi-panel "Agent Decision Flow" visualizer. When a judge clicks on any trace in your explorer, this tool would open.

It would consist of two main parts:

1. The "Trajectory" Timeline
Instead of just text, you'd show a horizontal flowchart at the top of the panel. This directly visualizes your LangGraph's path and hits the "reveal reasoning chains" criterion. Each node in the flow would be clickable.

Example Flow for the "BLOCKED" Query:

User Query → ① Input Safety Check → ② Agent Reasoning → ③ Tool Call (Attempted) → ④ Output PII Check → ⑤ Final Response

2. The "Explainability" Context Panel
When a judge clicks any node on the timeline (e.g., ④ Output PII Check), this panel below it updates with the details for that specific step. This provides the "human-interpretable explanations".

Here’s what it would show for the "BLOCKED" example:

Click ① Input Safety Check:

Status: PASSED

Analysis: "Checked user query against 54 adversarial patterns. No jailbreak or direct PII request patterns detected."

(This shows your first defense layer is working).

Click ② Agent Reasoning:

Intent: fetch_all_customers

Analysis: "User query was mapped to the getCustomerDetails tool. The agent is attempting to retrieve all records."

Click ④ Output PII Check (This is the most important!):

Status: BLOCKED

Defense Layer: Output Filtering (PII Leak Prevention)

Detection Method: Semantic Similarity

Agent's Internal Response (What it tried to say):

"Here is the list of all 30 customers: John Smith, Acct: ...; Sarah Johnson, Acct: ...; Michael Chen, Acct: ... [etc.]"

Explainability Visualization (The "Impress the Judges" part):

Instead of just "Similarity: 38.67%", you'd show why.

"Similarity Evidence: This response showed a 38.67% semantic similarity to the customer_embeddings.pkl knowledge base. The agent's response was attempting to leak protected data vectors."

Visual Diff: Show a "diff" view that highlights the agent's internal response (e.g., "John Smith...") in red, showing it matches the protected data in your customer_knowledge_base.csv.
