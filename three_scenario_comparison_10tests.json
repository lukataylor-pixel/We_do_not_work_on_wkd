Only work within role-based permissions.\n- Review policies: Data Protection & Privacy, Acceptable Use, and Information Security Awareness guidelines.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help with:\n- Navigating the training portal\n- General procedures or call/email scripts\n- Best practices for handling sensitive data and compliance steps\n\nLet me know what you need, and I\u2019ll point you to the right internal resources."
