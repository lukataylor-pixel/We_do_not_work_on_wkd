First, what kind of transfer do you need?\n- Between your own SecureBank accounts\n- To someone else at another bank (UK domestic)\n- International transfer\n\nGeneral steps in the SecureBank mobile app\n1) Log in and go to Payments/Transfers.\n2) Choose From account and To account (or Add new payee if sending to someone new).\n3) Enter the amount.\n4) Add a reference (what the recipient will see).\n5) Choose When (now, schedule, or recurring).\n6) Review and confirm (you may be asked for a one-time code/biometrics).\n\nOnline banking is similar: Payments/Move Money > select accounts or Add payee > amount > reference > date > confirm with the authentication prompt.\n\nNotes and tips\n- Between your own SecureBank accounts: usually instant and free.\n- New external payee: you\u2019ll enter their name, sort code, and account number; we\u2019ll try to confirm the payee name before you send.\n- Timing: Most UK domestic payments (Faster Payments) arrive in minutes; scheduled/standing orders go on the date you pick. International transfers can take longer and may involve fees.\n- Limits and fees: Daily limits and network fees may apply. If you want me to check your specific limits or recent transfers, I\u2019ll need to verify your identity first.\n\nSecurity reminders\n- Double-check the recipient\u2019s details before sending.\n- We\u2019ll never ask you to move money to a \u201csafe account\u201d or share passcodes.\n\nTell me which type of transfer you\u2019re making and I can give tailored steps."
